# reservedwords
this script builds collections of all the various reserved words used in q.

In addition to the contents of .Q.res (the names of the k primitives) it builds a
list of the datatype names, the modifiers possible on date and time values, a list of 
the various .z *pseudo-functions*, and all the names in the reserved locale .q

The lists can be used for building syntax colouring files, for command completion and
for whining about poor choices of column names.
